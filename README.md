# Features_And_Functionalities

- Basically this is an E-commerce website where there is a Home page where there are many of the brands category. Each category have some products based on that brand category. If an user click on the brand card he/she will see the products as well. 

- In the products page, each of the products have details and update option. If an user click on the details option he/she can see the details of the product. And can take decision to make cart the product. On the other hand, after clicking on the Update option an admin can change / update the product name, image, type, price, description etc. 

- Remember here is a thing! An user can view the details if he/she is registered on the website. And same as admin. An admin only can update product if he/she is register and logged in. Because this website is based on the user authentication system. 

- Entering the product details page, a login page will be visible there. After providing correct user email and password an user can enter to the details page and can add the product to cart list as well. 

- In the header section there is a My cart page, where each of the cart items are added together. Here is also a user authentication system. If the user is logged in then he/she will can see their products cart and take action to buy or others.

- In header there is also a Add Product page. Where, by providing products information the product can be added to the products page based on the brands.

- There is also a delete option for each of the products in My cart page. An user can easily delete the product from the cart list. 

- The main part of the web site is server side. I used here mongoDB for database. Each of the Brands, products category and cart list are stored in the database. And those data are came from the database to the users interface while browsing. 

- If an user is logged in to website, the user name, profile picture and the logout button will appear on the header section. If the user clicks on the logout button, he/she will be logged out from the website.

- There is also two of the section in home page. Where one is for help and information for the user. Thats mean customer care center for various support. And the other is products/ website features. And also there is a footer for various social links and supports of the website.
